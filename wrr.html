            <h2>Waste Reuse</h2>
            <p>
                Waste reuse refers to the practice of utilizing items or materials again for the same or a different purpose instead of disposing of them after initial use. It involves extending the lifespan of products or materials through various means, contributing to resource conservation and waste reduction.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Examples of Waste Reuse:</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Refillable Containers:</h4>
                    <p>Using refillable containers for products like soap, shampoo, and cooking oil instead of purchasing single-use plastic bottles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Repairing and Repurposing:</h4>
                    <p>Repairing damaged items such as clothing, electronics, or furniture to extend their usability. Alternatively, repurposing old items for new uses, such as using glass jars as storage containers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Donating and Sharing:</h4>
                    <p>Donating gently used clothing, toys, or household items to charities, thrift stores, or community swap events for others to use.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Benefits of Waste Reuse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Resource Conservation:</h4>
                    <p>Waste reuse reduces the demand for new raw materials, preserving natural resources such as water, energy, and minerals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Waste Reduction:</h4>
                    <p>By keeping items in circulation for longer, waste reuse helps divert materials from landfills, reducing environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cost Savings:</h4>
                    <p>Reusing items often costs less than purchasing new ones, offering financial savings to individuals and businesses.</p>

            <h2>Waste Recycling</h2>
            <p>
                Waste recycling involves the collection, processing, and transformation of discarded materials into new products or materials. It aims to recover valuable resources from waste streams, reduce the consumption of raw materials, and minimize the environmental impact of disposal.
            </p>
        </section>

            <section id="about">
                <h2>What is Waste Recycling?</h2>
                <p>Waste recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new products to prevent the depletion of valuable resources, reduce energy usage, and minimize environmental pollution. Recycling involves collecting, sorting, processing, and remanufacturing discarded materials into usable items, thus diverting them from landfills and incinerators.</p>

                <h2>How Does Waste Recycling Work?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Collection</h4>
                        <p>Waste materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal are collected from homes, businesses, and public spaces through curbside collection programs, drop-off centers, or recycling bins.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sorting</h4>
                        <p>Collected materials are transported to recycling facilities where they are sorted based on their type and composition. Advanced sorting technologies, including conveyor belts, magnets, and optical sensors, are used to separate different types of materials efficiently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Processing</h4>
                        <p>Once sorted, the materials undergo processing to prepare them for recycling. This may involve cleaning, shredding, and breaking down materials into smaller pieces to facilitate the recycling process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Remanufacturing</h4>
                        <p>Processed materials are then transformed into new products through remanufacturing processes. For example, recycled paper can be pulped and reformed into new paper products, while recycled plastic can be melted and molded into various plastic items.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Distribution</h4>
                        <p>The recycled products are distributed to consumers through retail outlets, wholesalers, or directly to manufacturers who incorporate them into their production processes.</p>

            <h2>Waste Reduction</h2>
            <p>
                Waste reduction, also known as waste minimization or waste prevention, involves reducing the amount of waste generated at the source. It focuses on preventing waste creation, rather than managing or treating waste after it's produced.

        <h3>Why is Waste Reduction Important?</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Conservation of Resources:</h4> By reducing waste, we conserve valuable natural resources such 
                as water, energy, and raw materials. This helps in preserving natural habitats and ecosystems.</li>
                
                <li><h4>Reduction of Pollution:</h4> Waste disposal methods, such as landfilling and incineration, contribute 
                to air, water, and soil pollution. By reducing waste, we minimize the release of harmful pollutants into
                 the environment.</li>
                
                <li><h4>Landfill Space Preservation:</h4> Landfills are finite spaces, and their expansion contributes to habitat destruction
                 and groundwater contamination. Waste reduction helps in extending the lifespan of existing landfills and reducing
                  the need for new ones.</li>
                
                <li><h4> Change Mitigation:</h4> The production, transportation, and disposal of waste generate greenhouse gas emissions,
                 contributing to climate change. Waste reduction initiatives, such as composting and recycling, help in reducing 
                 carbon emissions and mitigating climate change impacts.</li>

            <!-- Detailed content about waste reduction strategies goes here -->


<ol>
    <li><h4>Source Reduction:</h4> Source reduction involves minimizing waste generation at the point of origin. This can be achieved
         by using durable and reusable products, purchasing items with minimal packaging, and opting for products with longer 
         lifespans.</li>
    <li><h4>Reuse:</h4> Reusing items instead of disposing of them helps in extending their lifespan and reducing the need for new 
        products. This can include using refillable containers, repairing damaged items, and donating unwanted goods.</li>
    <li><h4>Recycling:</h4> Recycling involves processing discarded materials into new products, thereby conserving resources and reducing 
        waste sent to landfills. Commonly recycled materials include paper, glass, plastic, and metal.</li>
    <li><h4>Composting:</h4> Composting organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, allows for the natural decomposition of 
        materials into nutrient-rich compost. This compost can be used to enrich soil and support plant growth.</li>
